                        <p> What is the name of the philosophical concept where any single part of an entity may be replaced
                            by an exact copy without changing that entity's "essence," and therefore an entire entity may 
                            be replaced piece by piece without becoming a wholey new entity with a different "Essence."</p>

                            <h3>Perception as Reality</h3>
                            <p>Which philosopher created the thought experiment of the "demon," in which the thinker's 
                                mind has been left intact, however all of their sensory perceptions are controlled by an
                                external entity. This "demon" controlling the thinker's perceptions by nature controls their
                                thoughts without direct impact by controlling everything they can percieve, and therefore the context
                                of their thoughts. 
                            </p>

                                component piece or measurement of energy that constitutes all larger energy formations,

                            <p> What was the ultimate goal of the greek stoics, who believed that the character 
                                of a man was not dictated by that which he had done, nor by how he felt about it, 
                                but instead by what a man had survived and remained impassionate, reasoned, and 
                                rational about said events.
